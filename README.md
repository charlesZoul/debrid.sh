# debrid.sh
Shell script for download with alldebrid account

## Requirements
 - aria2c
 - curl (for api dialog)
 - bash (I suppose that any sh compatible shell does work, but I am only sure for bash)
 - an alldebrid.com account (for getting an apikey)

## Note
Sorry, this script is as ugly as my english. If you have an idea for make it better, do it.
